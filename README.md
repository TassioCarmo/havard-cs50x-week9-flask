# Ajax/flask

## What did i learn

## Web programming

http-server can’t process other types of requests, like form inputs from the user.

A file might be in a folder, like folder/file.html, and that reference is known as a **path**. A path can also be called a **route**, which does not need to refer to an actual file.

To get an input from the user you'll need to use ?key=value like http://www.example.com/route?key=value

## flask

Just like bootstrap is used for CSS and javascript flask is used for python

Flask is also a framework, where the library of code also comes with a set of conventions for how it should be used. For example, like other libraries, Flask includes functions we can use to parse requests individually, but as a framework, also requires our program’s code to be organized in a certain way:
```
app.py
requirements.txt
static/
templates/
```
- app.py will have the Python code for our web server.
- requirements.py includes a list of required libraries for our application.
- static/ is a directory of static files, like images and CSS and JavaScript files.
- templates/ is a directory for HTML files that will form our pages.
