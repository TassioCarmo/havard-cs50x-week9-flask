## Web programming

http-server canâ€™t process other types of requests, like form inputs from the user.

A file might be in a folder, like folder/file.html, and that reference is known as a **path**. A path can also be called a **route**, which does not need to refer to an actual file.

To get an input from the user you'll need to use ?key=value like http://www.example.com/route?key=value
